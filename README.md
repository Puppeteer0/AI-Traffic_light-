# AI-Traffic_light-
This is a traffic signal system design based on multi-objective tracking

#Model Deployed

Using the Multi Object Tracking Algorithm (MOT) for traffic flow monitoring at intersections, and designing a self adapting congestion judgment algorithm to dynamically adjust the duration of traffic lights.

#System Design

Adopting the concept of 'front and rear separation'. Design the system front-end using Vue framework and write the system back-end using Django framework, ensuring communication between the front-end and back-end through WebSocket class.

#System Visualization

Baidu Maps API was called, and Echarts was used to visualize various traffic information, giving users a clear and intuitive display.
